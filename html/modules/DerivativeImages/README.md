Derivative Images (module for Omeka S)
======================================

[Derivative Images] is a module for [Omeka S] that allows to recreate all
derivative files from the original media, if they are still available. It is
useful when you change the parameters of the thumbnails, for example bigger or
lower size, or when you add a new derivative type.

It is a full rewrite of the [plugin Derivative images] for [Omeka Classic] of
the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media.


Installation
------------

Uncompress files and rename plugin folder `DerivativeImages`.

See general end user documentation for [Installing a module] and follow the
config instructions.


Usage
-----

Because this is a tool that is rarely used, only the global admin can use it.

First, parameter your thumbnails in the file `config/local.config.php`.

Then, simply check the box in the config page of the module. The job is launched
in the background.

When the process is ended (check the job log), the module can be uninstalled.


TODO
----

- Add options to select medias by type, all thumbnails or only missing ones, all
  types of thumbnails or not.
- Manage creation of thumbnails for media without original (youtube…).


Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

It’s always recommended to backup your files and your databases and to check
your archives regularly so you can roll back if needed.


Troubleshooting
---------------

See online issues on the [module issues] page.
